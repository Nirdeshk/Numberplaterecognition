# Numberplaterecognition and traffic density estimation 
Developed an adaptive traffic control system which helps in reducing traffic congestion by counting the number of vehicles at a signal and changes the traffic signal based on the density of the vehicles at each side of the junction
Extended this system in recognizing a number plate from the vehicle, this is very much useful in detecting the stolen and know its location. Implemented this system using Neural Network techniques, and also used image processing and object detection
